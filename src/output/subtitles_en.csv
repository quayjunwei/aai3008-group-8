00:00:02.459,00:00:10.218,"with vectors and the basics. So you have something like A-vector, equal to 1, 2, 1 and the B-vector"
00:00:10.218,00:00:19.778,"equal to 0, 0, 4. You see in both vectors, you have three components, meaning you can"
00:00:19.778,00:00:29.859,"add these two vectors, for example. That means A-vector plus B-vector would be 1, 2, 1 plus 0, 0, 0."
00:00:29.858,00:00:42.019,"0, 0, 4 is equal to 1 plus 0, each component is 1, 2 plus 0 is 2 and 1 plus 4 is 5. And it is"
00:00:42.019,00:00:47.459,"similar to when I have already done basics, for example, for calculating with exponents."
00:00:47.459,00:00:54.819,"where you can just add Euro and Euro together, but not apples and NÃ¼rn, if you now have a"
00:00:54.819,00:01:02.899,"vector like C-vector equal to 1, 0, 1, 4. Then you have four components here and you can"
00:01:02.899,00:01:09.299,"not calculate B-vector plus C-vector, for example. What you can do with each vector"
00:01:09.299,00:01:14.659,"is you can multiply it by a number. So if you are asked to calculate,"
00:01:14.978,00:01:25.139,"try calculating 10 times C-vector, then you have 10 times, C-vector is 1, 0, 1, 4 and that again per"
00:01:25.139,00:01:37.338,"Component would be 10, 0, 10, 40. So, number times a vector. Likewise, of course, when subtracting,"
00:01:37.338,00:01:43.658,"so if you had to calculate A vector minus B vector, then you would have accordingly 1, 2, 1,"
00:01:43.658,00:01:54.459,"not minus 0, 0, 4, but in terms of the number of components, 1 minus 0 is 1, 2 minus 0 is 2, and 1,"
00:01:54.459,00:02:01.338,"minus 4, be careful with the signs, it is minus 3. And those are actually already"
00:02:01.338,00:02:06.819,some of the most important basics when moving on to the topic of the parametric form of a
00:02:06.819,00:02:13.338,"Calculate the straight parameter form of a plane direction vector, which will be the next topic. For this purpose,"
00:02:13.338,00:02:19.938,"I have created individual videos, which I will also add to the playlist on basics, including calculators with"
00:02:19.938,00:02:25.699,"vectors as well as reading points in space, for example. So in 3D, it is very, very popular,"
00:02:26.299,00:02:31.579,"that you have something like how you multiply vectors, then you are dealing with a dot product,"
00:02:31.579,00:02:37.579,"then you also have a special notation when it comes to a cross product, but that will come later."
00:02:37.579,00:02:41.979,"thematically, if it even comes at all, later on when you delve a bit deeper into the subject"
00:02:41.979,00:02:47.899,"and if you have a basic understanding, then you'll actually breeze through the topic easily"

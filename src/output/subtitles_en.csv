00:00:00.000,00:00:10.108,"So you've got a vector equal to 1, 2, 1 and the B vector equal to 0, 0, 4."
00:00:10.108,00:00:18.987,"You see with both vectors, you have three components, that is, you can add these two vectors, for example."
00:00:18.987,00:00:26.987,"That means A vector plus B vector would be 1, 2, 1 plus 0, 0, 0."
00:00:26.987,00:00:37.987,"0, 0, 4 is equal to 1 plus 0, per component is 1, 2 plus 0 is 2 and 1 plus 4 is 5."
00:00:37.987,00:00:43.987,"And it's similar to what I've done before, for example, for computing with power,"
00:00:43.987,00:00:49.987,"where you can calculate the euro and the euro, but not apples and nurses."
00:00:49.987,00:00:58.987,"If you now had a vector like C vector equals 1, 0, 1, 4, then you have four components here."
00:00:58.987,00:01:02.987,"For example, you can't count B vector plus C vector now."
00:01:02.987,00:01:09.987,What you can do with every vector is you can multiply it with a number.
00:01:09.987,00:01:20.987,"So, if you're supposed to calculate for example, why don't you calculate 10 times C vector, then you have 10 times C vector is 1, 0, 1, 4."
00:01:20.987,00:01:29.987,"And that again per component would be 10, 0, 10, 40. So number times a vector."
00:01:29.987,00:01:33.987,"Of course, it's the same way about subtracting."
00:01:33.987,00:01:43.987,"So if you'd have to count A vector, minus B vector, you'd have gone equal to 1, 2, 1, minus 0, 0, 4,"
00:01:43.987,00:01:55.987,"but the number from components 1, minus 0 is 1, 2, minus 0 is 2 and 1, minus 4, of course also watch signs, is minus 3."
00:01:56.987,00:02:03.987,"These are actually already with the most important basics, when it goes on to the subject of parameter form of a straight,"
00:02:03.987,00:02:08.987,Calculate the parameter form of a flat direction vector where it will still be about.
00:02:08.987,00:02:18.987,"For this I have made individual videos, I also pack into the playlist basics, both with vectors as well as reading points."
00:02:18.987,00:02:26.987,"In space, for example, so in 3D it's very, very popular that you have something like you multiply vectors,"
00:02:26.987,00:02:32.987,"There you are with a scale product, then you still have a special spelling when it comes to a cross product,"
00:02:32.987,00:02:38.987,"But this comes thematically, if it comes at all later, when you get a little deeper into matter."
00:02:38.987,00:02:46.987,"And if you have such a basic consensus, then you can actually easily get through the topic and arithmetic shouldn't be difficult for you."

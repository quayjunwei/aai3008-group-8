0.00 --> 4.00
 I learned to get along and throw you back.

4.00 --> 8.00
 From outer space, I just walked in and find you here

8.00 --> 10.00
 With that said, look upon your face.

10.00 --> 12.00
 I should have changed that stupid lock.

12.00 --> 14.00
 I should have made you leave your key.

14.00 --> 16.00
 If I had no for just one second,

16.00 --> 19.00
 You'd be back to bottom, go on now go.

19.00 --> 20.00
 Walk out the door.

20.00 --> 21.00
 Frank.

21.00 --> 24.00
 Bring your head in this window,

24.00 --> 26.00
 Fly, roll it up in there.

26.00 --> 27.00
 Got it.

30.00 --> 34.00
 Frank.
